# 5MLET-Datathon - Passos Mágicos (Student Lagging Prediction)

## 1. Project Overview

### Objective
This project aims to predict the academic lagging risk (`defasagem`) for students supported by the **Passos Mágicos Association**. By identifying students at risk early, the NGO can implement targeted psychosocial and pedagogical interventions.

### Proposed Solution
A complete MLOps pipeline designed to handle student data from ingestion to real-time inference:
- **Medallion Data Pipeline**: Structured data processing through Landing, Bronze (cleaning), Silver (feature engineering & drift detection), and Gold (modeling) layers.
- **MLOps Lifecycle**: Experiment tracking, parameter logging, and model versioning using **MLflow**.
- **Inference Service**: A production-ready **FastAPI** application serving predictions integrated with an **SQLite Feature Store**.
- **Observability**: Real-time service monitoring via **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, with data distribution monitoring through **Evidently AI**.

### Tech Stack
- **Python Version**: `>= 3.13`
- **ML Frameworks**: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`
- **API & Serving**: `FastAPI`, `Uvicorn`, `Pydantic`
- **Serialization & Validation**: `Pandera` (schema enforcement), `YAML` (configuration)
- **Tests**: `Pytest`
- **Containerization**: `Docker`, `Docker Compose`
- **Monitoring & Observability**: `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Evidently AI`
- **Orchestration & Tooling**: `MLflow` (tracking), `UV` (dependency management), `Make` (task automation)

## 4. Deploy Instructions

### Quick Start (Local)

1. **Install uv**: Ensure you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed.
2. **Initialize Environment**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   make setup
   ```
3. **Run Full Pipeline**: (Ingestion -> Processing -> Training)
   ```bash
   make train-presets
   ```

### Running with Docker

To spin up the entire ecosystem (API, MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana) in one go:
```bash
make docker-up
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`, the MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`, Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090`, and Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Model Promotion (Production)

The FastAPI application is configured to load the model using the **`production`** alias. After training a model, you **must** promote it in the MLflow UI for it to be used by the API:

1.  **Access MLflow**: Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
2.  **Navigate to Models**: Click on the **Models** tab in the top navigation bar.
3.  **Select the Model**: Click on `passos_magicos_defasagem_v1`.
4.  **Assign Alias**:
    - Click on the **Version** number you wish to use (e.g., *Version 1*).
    - In the **Aliases** section, click the `+` button and type `production`.
5.  **Restart API**: The API loads the model during startup. If it was already running, restart the container or the local process to pick up the new model version.

To stop the services:
```bash
make docker-down
```

---

## 5. API

Interact with the API once it's running. Documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Health Check
**Description**: Verifies the system status, including whether the ML model and student database are correctly loaded.
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Model Discovery
**Description**: Retrieves metadata about the currently active model in production, including its version, alias, and hyperparameters.
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/model
```

### Trigger New Training
**Description**: Initiates the training pipeline as a background task. The model will be trained and registered in MLflow.
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/train
```

### Prediction by Student RA
**Description**: Performs a real-time risk prediction for a student using their unique RA. Features are fetched from the **SQLite Feature Store**.
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/1
```

## 6. ML Pipeline Steps

The pipeline follows a robust automated workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Historical data is landed in the `data/00_landing` zone as Excel files.
2. **Bronze (Raw/Clean)**: Inconsistent column names are normalized, and basic type casting is performed.
3. **Silver (Trusted)**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Calculates years in institution, academic indices (INDE, IPP), and encodes categorical features.
   - **Data Drift Monitoring**: New batches are compared against the historical baseline using **Evidently AI**. Reports are saved in `data/reports`.
4. **Gold (Aggregated)**: Data is prepared in Parquet format and synchronized with the **SQLite Feature Store** for low-latency inference.
5. **Model Training**:
   - Fetches the Gold dataset.
   - Trains models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM) based on current configuration.
   - Logs metrics, parameters, and artifacts to **MLflow**.
6. **Model Registry & Serving**: The best model is registered and promoted to *Production* state for the FastAPI application to consume.

## 7. Additional Usage

These `make` commands provide additional shortcuts for development and maintenance:

### Simulation & QA
- **Simulate Data Drift**: Ingests 2025 data to trigger the drift detection report.
  ```bash
  make simulate_drift
  ```
- **Run Tests**: Executes the `pytest` suite.
  ```bash
  make test
  ```

### MLOps & Infrastructure
- **MLflow UI**: Start the tracking server locally.
  ```bash
  make ui
  ```

### Model Configuration (`config.yaml`)

The project uses a centralized configuration file at `config/config.yaml` to manage experiments.

Centralizing parameters in a YAML file promotes decoupling between the model's logic and its hyperparameters. This ensures experiment reproducibility, facilitates audit trails within MLflow, and provides a single source of truth for the entire training pipeline without requiring code changes.

You can modify these parameters to test different algorithms and tuning strategies:

- **MLOps & Tracking**:
    - `experiment_name`: Grouping of related runs in MLflow.
    - `run_name`: Specific identifier for the current training execution.
    - `registered_model_name`: The name used in the MLflow Model Registry (consumed by the API).
- **Data & Features**:
    - `target_col`: The name of the column to predict (default: `target_defasagem`).
    - `numerical`, `categorical`, `binary`: Lists of features to be included in the training pipeline.
- **Model Selection & Tuning**:
    - `model.type`: Choose between `"random_forest"`, `"xgboost"`, or `"lightgbm"`.
    - `model.params`: Hyperparameters specific to the chosen algorithm (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`).

**To test a new model**:
1. Open `config/config.yaml`.
2. Change `model.type` to your desired algorithm (e.g., `"xgboost"`).
3. Update `model.params` with the appropriate keys for that algorithm.
4. Run `make train` to log the new experiment to MLflow.

**Advanced Training**:
You can also run training using a specific configuration file without modifying the default one:
```bash
make train CONFIG=config/my_experiment.yaml
```

### Maintenance
- **Clean Environment**: Deletes local data lake files, models, and artifacts (use with caution).
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```

## 8. Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to maintain high code quality and prevent the introduction of bugs. Every Pull Request to the `main` branch triggers an automated pipeline that performs the following checks:

### CI Pipeline Components

1.  **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: Used for high-speed dependency management. The CI environment is synced using `uv sync` to ensure it matches the local environment.
2.  **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)**: An extremely fast Python linter. It checks for style violations, unused imports, and common coding errors.
3.  **[Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)**: A static type checker that enforces type safety based on Python's type hints, catching logical errors early.
4.  **[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)**: Executes the project's test suite to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Guidelines for Contributors

To ensure your changes can be merged smoothly, follow these steps before opening a Pull Request:

1.  **Sync Dependencies**: Ensure your environment is up to date.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
2.  **Run Linting**: Clean up code style and unused imports.
    ```bash
    uv run ruff check . --fix
    ```
3.  **Check Types**: Verify type safety.
    ```bash
    uv run mypy src/ app/
    ```
4.  **Run Tests**: Confirm that all tests pass.
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

> ⚠️ A green checkmark from the CI environment is **required** for any Pull Request to be merged.

## 9. Future Implementations

To further mature the platform, the following points are planned for future development:

- **☁️ Cloud Ingestion & Storage**: Transition from local filesystem to **S3/GCS** for the Medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) to ensure scalability.
- **🧪 Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Integrate **Optuna** into the `train.py` script to automatically search for the best configuration for each model type.
- **📊 Advanced Drift Monitoring**: Export **Evidently AI** metrics to **Prometheus** to enable real-time alerting in **Grafana** whenever data drift is detected.
- **🛡️ API Security**: Implement **JWT (JSON Web Token)** authentication to secure the inference and training endpoints.
- **🔄 Continuous Training (CT)**: Build a fully automated pipeline where drift detection or model performance decay triggers a new training run and registration in MLflow.
